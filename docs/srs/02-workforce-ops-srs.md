Phase 2 includes:

1. Attendance
2. Shift & Work Schedule
3. Leave Management
4. Approval Workflow
5. Notification Center
6. Payroll Management
7. Reports & Dashboards

Phase 2 excludes:

- Recruitment pipeline management
- Onboarding/offboarding task orchestration
- Performance review cycles
- Training programs
- Asset lifecycle tracking
- Mobile app delivery
- Multi-tenant platform concerns

### 1.3 References

### 1.4 Assumptions

- Phase 1 capabilities are implemented and stable.
- Employee, organization, contract, and configuration data are available as trusted upstream data.
- Queue workers exist for asynchronous calculations, imports, exports, and notification fan-out.
- Payroll is initially single-country, with Vietnamese labor context as baseline.

## 2. System Overview

### 2.2 Primary Actors

| Actor | Phase 2 responsibilities |
| --- | --- |
| Employee | Check-in/out, submit leave/request forms, view balances and payslips. |
| Department Manager | Approve attendance adjustments, leave, overtime, and scoped requests. |
| HR Staff | Review attendance issues, maintain shift calendars, support leave and payroll inputs. |
| HR Manager | Owns policy settings, approvals, workforce oversight, and reporting. |
| Accountant/Payroll | Processes payroll periods, adjustments, approvals, and exports. |
| Admin | Maintains workflow, notification, and technical configuration. |

### 2.3 Phase 2 Success Outcome

At the end of Phase 2, the company can operate timekeeping, leave, approvals, notifications, and monthly payroll with traceability and auditable controls.

## 3. Functional Requirements

## 3.1 Attendance

### 3.1.1 Description

The system shall collect attendance inputs, normalize raw logs, apply schedule and approved leave context, and produce employee timesheets for workforce operations and payroll.

### 3.1.2 Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| ATT-FR-001 | The system shall capture attendance from supported sources including web, manual entry, import, device logs, and GPS-backed check-in when enabled. |
| ATT-FR-002 | The system shall store raw attendance logs separately from calculated attendance results. |
| ATT-FR-003 | The system shall calculate daily attendance outcomes using shift schedule, approved leave, holidays, weekends, and configured attendance rules. |
| ATT-FR-004 | The system shall support late arrival, early departure, absence, overtime, and attendance adjustment scenarios. |
| ATT-FR-005 | The system shall support cross-day and overnight shifts. |
| ATT-FR-006 | The system shall support manual attendance adjustment requests requiring approval. |
| ATT-FR-007 | The system shall maintain calculated timesheets by employee and payroll period. |
| ATT-FR-008 | The system shall preserve recalculation auditability when approved requests or shift assignments change. |
| ATT-FR-009 | The system shall support monthly attendance closing to stabilize payroll inputs. |

### 3.1.3 Business Rules

- Raw logs are source-of-truth inputs; calculated timesheets are derived records.
- Attendance calculation must consider approved leave before marking absence.
- Attendance adjustments must not silently overwrite original raw logs.
- Cross-day shifts must attribute worked time to configured payroll/date policies.
- Closed attendance periods require privileged reopening with audit.

### 3.1.4 Data Model Sketch

Core entities:

- AttendanceRawLog
- AttendanceTimesheet
- AttendanceDailyResult
- AttendanceAdjustmentRequest
- AttendanceSource
- AttendancePeriod

### 3.1.5 Use Case — Employee Requests Attendance Adjustment

1. Employee views daily attendance record.
2. Employee submits adjustment reason and evidence.
3. System validates request window and duplicate submission rules.
4. Workflow engine routes request to approver(s).
5. Approved result triggers attendance recalculation.
6. System audits request and recalculation.

## 3.2 Shift & Work Schedule

### 3.2.1 Description

The system shall define shift templates and assign work schedules to employees or groups.

### 3.2.2 Functional Requirements

| ID | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| SHF-FR-001 | The system shall manage shift templates including start/end times, breaks, tolerance rules, and overtime thresholds. |
| SHF-FR-002 | The system shall support normal, flexible, remote, split, and overnight shifts when configured. |
| SHF-FR-003 | The system shall assign shifts to employees, departments, or groups for date ranges. |
| SHF-FR-004 | The system shall support shift change and shift swap requests requiring approval when configured. |

| SHF-FR-006 | The system shall expose scheduled shift data to attendance calculation and employee self-service views. |
| SHF-FR-007 | The system shall audit shift template and assignment changes. |

### 3.2.3 Business Rules

- Shift assignments with overlapping effective ranges must be blocked or resolved deterministically.
- Overnight shifts must define how attendance is mapped to date and payroll period.
- Flexible shifts still require rule-based lateness/absence interpretation when enabled.
- Shift changes after attendance close require privileged override and audit.

### 3.2.4 Use Case — HR Assigns Monthly Shift Schedule

1. HR selects employee set or department.
2. HR chooses shift template and date range.
3. System validates no conflicting active schedule.
4. System saves assignments.
5. System queues attendance recalculation for impacted days if needed.
6. System audits change.

## 3.3 Leave Management

### 3.3.3 Business Rules

- Balance deduction occurs only when leave is approved or reaches configured approval stage.
- Approved leave supersedes absence classification for the same approved period.
- Leave cancellation after payroll close requires special handling and audit.
- Holiday and weekend treatment depends on leave policy configuration.

### 3.3.4 Use Case — Employee Applies for Annual Leave

1. Employee selects leave type and date/time range.
2. System previews requested duration and remaining balance.
3. System validates policy and overlap rules.
4. System submits request to workflow engine.
5. Approver approves or rejects with reason.
6. System updates leave balance and attendance impact on approval.
7. System sends notification and records audit logs.

### 3.4.3 Business Rules

- Request status changes must be deterministic and traceable.
- Approval template changes affect new requests only unless explicitly migrated.
- Delegated approval must preserve original approver context in audit history.
- Requests already consumed by payroll or attendance close may require reversal/reopen process, not silent edit.

### 3.4.4 Use Case — Manager Approves Leave Request

1. Manager receives pending approval notification.
2. Manager opens request details.
3. System shows request context, balance impact, and employee schedule context.
4. Manager approves or rejects with comment when required.

- Large exports should run asynchronously.

## 4. Cross-Module Workflow

### 4.1 Monthly Workforce Operations Cycle

```text
Admin/HR configures shifts, leave types, workflow, payroll settings
  -> Employees check in/out and submit requests
  -> Managers/HR approve requests
  -> Attendance engine calculates daily timesheets
  -> Attendance period closes
  -> Payroll runs using attendance + leave + contract data
  -> Payroll approved, locked, published
  -> Dashboards/reports expose outcomes
```
