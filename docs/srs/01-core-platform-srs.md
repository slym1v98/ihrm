# Phase 1 Software Requirements Specification — Core Platform

Version: 0.1  
Date: 2026-06-30  
Status: Draft for review

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document defines the software requirements for Phase 1 of the eHRM system: Core Platform. Phase 1 establishes the data, security, configuration, and audit foundation required by all later phases.

### 1.2 Scope

Phase 1 includes:

1. Identity & Access
2. Organization
3. Employee Master
4. Employment Contract
5. Employee Document
6. Configuration
7. Audit & Activity Log

Phase 1 excludes:

- Attendance calculation
- Shift scheduling
- Leave balance calculation
- Payroll calculation
- Recruitment pipeline
- Onboarding/offboarding task automation
- Performance management
- Training management
- Asset management
- Mobile application
- Multi-tenant SaaS

### 1.3 References

- `00-enterprise-srs.md`
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/ROADMAP_DETAIL_1.md`
- `docs/ROADMAP_DETAIL_2.md`

### 1.4 Assumptions

- The enterprise context is single-tenant.
- Backend uses Laravel 12 and PHP 8.4.
- Frontend uses NextJS.
- PostgreSQL is the primary relational datastore.
- Redis supports cache, session, queue, lock, and rate-limit needs.
- MinIO stores private employee files.
- Phase 1 must be production-grade enough to support later workforce and payroll modules.

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Phase Boundary

Phase 1 creates trusted master data and access control. Later phases must depend on Phase 1 rather than defining their own identity, organization, employee, document, configuration, or audit models.

### 2.2 Primary Actors

| Actor              | Phase 1 responsibilities                                                 |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Admin              | Configure roles, permissions, master data, system settings.              |
| HR Manager         | Manage organization, employees, contracts, documents, reports.           |
| HR Staff           | Maintain employee data within assigned scope.                            |
| Department Manager | View scoped employee records and reporting lines.                        |
| Employee           | View own profile and allowed documents.                                  |
| Accountant/Payroll | View approved employee and contract data needed for later payroll setup. |

### 2.3 Phase 1 Success Outcome

At the end of Phase 1, HR can create the organization structure, create employees, attach contracts and documents, enforce scoped access, and prove every material change through audit logs.

| AUD-FR-001 | The system shall record audit logs for create, update, delete, status change, login, failed login, logout, role change, permission change, file upload, file download, import, and export actions. |
| AUD-FR-002 | Each audit log shall include actor, action, target entity, timestamp, request metadata, and result.                                                                                                |
| AUD-FR-003 | Data change audit logs shall include before and after values for changed fields where safe and practical.                                                                                          |
| AUD-FR-004 | Audit logs shall be append-only for normal application users.                                                                                                                                      |
| AUD-FR-005 | The system shall restrict audit log viewing to authorized users.                                                                                                                                   |
| AUD-FR-006 | The system shall support filtering audit logs by actor, action, module, entity, date range, and result.                                                                                            |

### 3.7.3 Business Rules

- Audit logs must not be editable through normal application workflows.
- Failed authorization attempts for sensitive resources should be logged.
- File downloads of sensitive HR documents must be logged.
- Audit records must preserve enough context to answer who changed what, when, and from where.

### 3.7.4 Data Model Sketch

Core entities:

- AuditLog
- ActivityLog

Key attributes:

- AuditLog: id, actor_user_id, action, module, entity_type, entity_id, before_payload, after_payload, ip_address, user_agent, occurred_at, result

### 3.7.5 Use Case — HR Updates Employee Department

Preconditions:

- HR user has employee edit permission and correct data scope.
- Employee exists.
- New department exists.

Main flow:

1. HR updates employee department.
2. System validates permission and data scope.
3. System updates current employment data in a transaction.
4. System creates employee history record with effective date.
5. System creates audit log with before/after values.

Postconditions:

- Employee current department changes.
- Historical department change is traceable.
- Audit log proves the operation.

## 4. Cross-Module Workflow

### 4.1 Onboard Employee Master Data

```text
Admin configures roles + code rules
  -> HR creates organization structure
  -> HR creates employee profile
  -> HR assigns department, position, manager
  -> HR creates first contract
  -> HR uploads identity/contract documents
  -> Admin or HR creates linked user account if needed
  -> System audits all write operations
```

### 4.2 Preconditions

- Required lookup values exist.
- Branch, department, and position exist.
- HR user has permissions and data scope.

### 4.3 Postconditions

- Employee exists with valid organization assignment.
- Contract exists when required by HR process.
- Employee documents are protected in MinIO.
- User account exists only if employee needs login access.
- Audit logs exist for every material action.

## 5. Interface Requirements

### 5.1 API Requirements

The backend shall expose REST-style APIs grouped by domain. Endpoint naming may be refined during implementation, but Phase 1 must support these API categories:

- `/auth/*`
- `/users/*`
- `/roles/*`
- `/permissions/*`
- `/organization/*`
- `/employees/*`
- `/contracts/*`
- `/documents/*`
- `/configuration/*`
- `/audit-logs/*`

All protected APIs must authenticate, authorize, validate, and audit where applicable.

### 5.2 UI Requirements

The NextJS web app shall provide screens for:

- Login/logout
- User and role management
- Organization management
- Employee list/detail/create/edit
- Contract list/detail/create/edit
- Employee documents
- Configuration
- Audit log search

### 5.3 File Requirements

- Files shall be uploaded through authorized backend APIs.
- Files shall be stored in MinIO private buckets.
- Downloads shall use signed URL or backend streaming after permission check.
- File metadata shall be stored in PostgreSQL.

## 6. Data Scope Policy

### 6.1 Required Scopes

| Scope          | Meaning                                                |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Self           | User can access own linked employee record.            |
| Direct reports | User can access employees who report directly to them. |
| Department     | User can access employees in assigned department(s).   |
| Branch         | User can access employees in assigned branch(es).      |
| All company    | User can access all employees.                         |

### 6.2 Enforcement Rules

- API query results must be filtered by data scope.
- Detail endpoints must reject access outside data scope.
- Export endpoints must apply the same or stricter data scope.
- Document downloads must apply both employee data scope and document permission.
- UI hiding is not sufficient enforcement.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

### 7.1 Performance

- Employee list API shall support pagination, filtering, and sorting.
- Employee list API should respond within 500 ms p95 for common filters at target scale.
- Employee detail API should respond within 500 ms p95 under normal load.
- Audit log search may use indexed filters and pagination.
- File upload/download performance depends on object size, but metadata operations should remain responsive.

### 7.2 Security

- Passwords must be hashed using secure framework-supported hashing.
- Sensitive endpoints must be rate limited.
- Permissions must be enforced server-side.
- Employee PII must not be returned to unauthorized users.
- MinIO buckets must not be public.
- Audit logs must avoid secrets and raw credentials.

### 7.3 Reliability

- Employee create/update operations that affect history and audit must run in transactions.
- File metadata should not be committed if object upload fails.
- Orphaned object cleanup should be handled by scheduled maintenance if upload flow partially fails.

### 7.4 Backup and Retention

- PostgreSQL backup shall run daily with at least 30-day retention in Phase 1.
- MinIO object backup or replication strategy shall be defined before production launch.
- Audit logs shall be retained according to enterprise policy and must not be casually deleted.

### 7.5 Maintainability

- Phase 1 backend code should be organized by domain modules.
- Shared authorization and audit mechanisms should be reusable by later phases.
- Business rules should be covered by tests before payroll or attendance modules depend on them.

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

Phase 1 is accepted when all of the following are true:

1. Admin can create roles, permissions, users, and data-scope assignments.
2. HR can create company/branch/department/position structure.
3. HR can create an employee profile with department, position, manager, and status.
4. HR can create and renew employment contracts.
5. HR can upload employee documents to MinIO private storage.
6. Employee can view only their own allowed profile data.
7. Department Manager can view only scoped direct/department employees.
8. HR Staff access can be restricted by branch or department.
9. All create/update/delete/status/file/security actions produce audit logs.
10. Employee lifecycle can run through onboarding, probation, active, resigned, and archived states.
11. Deactivated organization/config records remain available for historical references.
12. Unauthorized API access is denied server-side.

## 9. Deferred to Later Phases

The following items are intentionally deferred to later SRS documents:

- Attendance device protocol details
- Leave accrual formulas
- Payroll formula engine
- Workflow engine configuration language
- Notification templates
- Recruitment pipeline stages
- Onboarding/offboarding checklist automation
- SSO provider specifics
