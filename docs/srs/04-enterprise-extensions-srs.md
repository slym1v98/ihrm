# Phase 4 Software Requirements Specification — Enterprise Extensions

Version: 0.1  
Date: 2026-06-30  
Status: Draft for review

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document defines the software requirements for Phase 4 of the eHRM system: Enterprise Extensions. This phase hardens the platform for broader enterprise controls, advanced integrations, mobile readiness, and operational scale.

### 1.2 Scope

Phase 4 includes:

1. SSO & Advanced Identity Controls
2. Advanced Integration Hub
3. Mobile Readiness & Self-Service Extensions
4. Advanced Analytics & Executive Reporting
5. Compliance Extensions
6. Scale Hardening & Operational Controls

- `01-core-platform-srs.md`
- `02-workforce-ops-srs.md`
- `03-talent-lifecycle-srs.md`
- `docs/ROADMAP.md`
- `docs/ROADMAP_DETAIL_1.md`
- `docs/ROADMAP_DETAIL_2.md`

### 1.4 Assumptions

- Phases 1–3 are stable enough to extend rather than redesign.
- Enterprise leadership requires stronger controls, broader reporting, and more ecosystem connectivity.
- API-first architecture remains the base for mobile and integration clients.

## 2. System Overview

### 2.1 Phase Boundary

Phase 4 adds enterprise-grade control planes and extension capabilities rather than redefining core HR business domains.

## 4. Cross-Module Outcome

### 4.1 Enterprise-Ready Platform

```text
Core domains stable
  -> Identity federated when needed
  -> External systems integrated safely
  -> Mobile self-service enabled via APIs
  -> Executive analytics expanded
  -> Compliance posture strengthened
  -> Scale operations hardened
```

## 5. Interface Requirements

### 5.1 API Categories

- `/sso/*`
- `/integrations/*`
- `/webhooks/*`
- `/mobile/*` (logical capability grouping, may map to existing APIs)
- `/analytics/*`
- `/compliance/*`
- `/ops/*`

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Security

- SSO, MFA, and integration secrets require stronger governance.
- Compliance exports and executive analytics must preserve least privilege.

### 6.2 Performance

- Analytical and archival operations should not degrade interactive HR workflows.
- Heavy integration and reporting tasks should be asynchronous.

### 6.3 Reliability

- Recovery procedures must be documented and testable.
- Integration retries must be bounded and observable.

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

1. Enterprise SSO can be enabled without breaking local authorization rules.
2. External integrations can be configured, executed, monitored, and audited.
3. APIs are stable enough for future mobile clients.
4. Executive dashboards and analytics are available to authorized roles.
5. Compliance-related retention, audit, and masking controls are available.
6. Operational hardening supports larger data volume and business criticality.

## 8. Deferred Beyond Current Roadmap

- Full multi-tenant SaaS transformation
- Full microservice decomposition
- Global multi-country payroll localization pack
